Prevent a product from being added to the cart if the stock is reserved - Pending Payment.

== Description ==

Prevent a product from being added to the cart if the stock is reserved (Pending Payment). Normally, WooCommerce allows to add the product and only gives the error of out of stock in the checkout.

== Installation ==

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donâ€™t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New and search for Better Management Reserved Stock - WooCommerce.
